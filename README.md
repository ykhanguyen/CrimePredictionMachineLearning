# CrimePredictionMachineLearning
Using machine learning to predict the crime rate in the new communities. 

Train the model based on 1994 US communities that takes into account 95 features such as the number of homesless people,
family size, percentage of children that graduate high school, size of police force, etc.

To avoid overfitting problem, I use the descent LASSO algorithm for this model.

The dataset is from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/communities/communities.names)
